I rated every story I read this week out of 10 because otherwise I'll forget in 5 years and have to reread them 😭

## Franz Kafka – Metamorphosis

The first book I read this week was Metamorphosis and heres every story rated :)

#### Metamorphosis – 8/10
It's just a classic and as good as I remembered it. I've always loved this book – very thought provoking


#### In the Penal Colony – 6/10
I liked this book and the way it's written (especially the officers dialogue) however overall I've read better Kafka

#### The Judgement: A Story for F. – 5/10
It was fine; and I think the point was to illustrate the power of words and I think it did that well enough

## Oscar Wilder – The Star-Child

The second book I read this week

#### The Happy Prince - 10/10

I loved this story; I was practically crying by the end it was really moving I'd probably say its the best of this weeks stories

#### The Nightingale and the Rose – 8/10

This story was also a favourite in terms of how thought provoking it was however I felt that compared to The Happy Prince it was missing something – although that's not to say I wasn't moved by the story.

#### The Selfish Giant – 5/10

This story was well written and I especially enjoyed that about it, however the story felt quite simplistic in its meaning compared to other stories.

#### The Devoted Friend – 6/10

A thought provoking story which made me think about my own friendships with people

#### The Remarkable Rocket – 5/10

This story was okay but I wouldn't rate it that highly – I just felt it was quite simplistic and lacked an amount of depth

#### The Young King – 6/10

I liked the stroy overall and I felt the story had some simmilar vibe (although different allegories) to The Star-Child which is a story I much preffered

#### The Birthday of the Infanta – 7/10

It was enjoyable to read but overally I didn't really feel like I saw a clear meaning (even after searching an analysis)

#### The Fisherman and his Soul - 10/10

This was my second favourite story I've read all week – it was fascinating to read and I loved the dialogue, I loved the conclusion and it was very thought provoking, I liked everything about this book and I'd definitely recommend it ❤️

#### The Star-Child - 8/10

I enjoyed this stroy it was very thought provoking and I'd say it was one of this week's favourite stories. I think the title is very sweet as well
