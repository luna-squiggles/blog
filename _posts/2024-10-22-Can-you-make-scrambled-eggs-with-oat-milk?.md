This morning I was planning to have scrambled eggs for breakfast– but I didn't have any milk, apart from oat. So this brings me to my question. Can you make scrambled eggs with oat milk? Let's test it.

For this recipe you're going to need 2 things;
- 3 eggs
- 2 teaspoons oat milk
- a little bit of olive oil

I used unsweetened oat milk and I think this aided to there being no discernible taste difference between eggs with normal milk and eggs with oat milk. Arguably the oat milk eggs are a little ✨creamier✨

Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the oat milk, and whisk

You might want to add one teaspoon at a time because one might be enough 🥰

I also crushed a bit of garlic into the mix but just because I really like garlic– and this is definitely optional for the recipe 🙃

Add the olive oil to a frying pan (just a little so it coats the bottom of the pan), heat to a medium heat, and add the whisked eggs.

There's some debate on the best way to scramble eggs. Gordon Ramsey apparently suggests a medium heat but take the pan off the heat every 30 seconds.

Personally I (mostly for convenience) use a low-medium heat, but don't take the pan off the heat.

The most important fact though is that scrambling eggs takes time and not to use too high a heat or your eggs with go dry.

Lastly, and this is completely optional but I chose this particular morning to have some sardines with my eggs.

I just heated these in the same frying pan with a bit of garlic (I know more garlic 😭)

I seasoned my breakfast with some cumin sees, paprika, chilli flakes, and a little bit of soy sauce.
